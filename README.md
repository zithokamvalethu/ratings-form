# ratings-form
In this repo, I have done a mini React App that has to submit a rating number and return asterisk that is equal to the rating number. I am using React classes to do it and I will run it using 'yarn start' on my VS code. I have created two inputs one will receive a value and one as a submit button. The other one is an 'input' it strictly takes integers and none other than numbers and therefore the input type is number. I had to write functions and methods for it to be able to submit and show the submitted value after submitting. It also returns an input that takes a number value. To use this app you need to first install the node modules needed to run it and secondly clone my repo and start or run it.
